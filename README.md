# python-api-challenge

This Challenge was a lot of fun to create. It was a lot of learning along the way as well, which was very informative. 

The visual outputs created on the maps were a thrill to observe. The fact that the Pandas dataframe datapoints can manifest on a worldmap in that manner is amazing to realize and seeing them manifest provides a satisfaction on the next level. Having the ability to hover over the points created and have them readout desired data through computation makes me feel empowered with new skills that I did not have. 

I am adding 2 screenshots of the map images created by my VacationPy code as I noticed that those displays did not upload as seen on my screen while commiting to this repo. I noticed that I was able to see the graphs created on the uploaded WeatherPy file and therefore not uploading them as well.

Thank you for the opportunity!
